I used this video for inspiration and help with the javaScript:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBcqGxrr9g8&ab_channel=GreatStack

I used this video as inspiration for some styling, transitions when creating the tooltip component. The person in the video only used css. So i made the functionality of the tooltip component in javascript to shorten the code length.

I did my own styling and tweaked some of the javascript code in order to save a couple of lines in the code and enhance performance.

I also used some chat GPT as I had trouble with getting the user answers to display in the summary
